eWiz: Event-based Data Manipulation
===================================
**An all-in-one event-based data manipulation and processing library.**

**eWiz** is an all-in-one event-based data manipulation library that allows you
to visualize, process, and manipulate data taken with any available event-based
sensor. This library is compatible with other APIs and frameworks, such as,
`PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `Tonic <https://tonic.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The aim of eWiz is the provision of a unified pipeline that allows for the
easy implementation of event-based algorithms, whether for standard computer
vision, deep learning, or optimization tasks. Ultimately, we aim to make eWiz
the go-to library to propel event-based research with :abbr:`SNNs (Spiking Neural Networks)`
and neuromorphic hardware.
