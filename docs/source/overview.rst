About eWiz
----------
eWiz is a Python library designed for efficient handling, manipulation, and visualization
of event-based data. It is particularly well-suited for applications in spiking
neural networks (SNNs), event-based cameras, and synthetic dataset generation.

Core Features
-------------
- **Comprehensive Support**: Handles event-based data streams, grayscale images,
  and optical flow data.
- **Optimized Storage**: Utilizes HDF5 with BLOSC compression for efficient
  data management.
- **Flexibility**: Compatible with real-world sensors (e.g., DAVIS) and synthetic
  data pipelines.
- **Time Mapping**: Automatically synchronizes multi-modal data.
- **Modular Design**: Includes modules for writing, reading, converting, and
  augmenting data.

Future Roadmap
--------------
1. Support for additional data types and modalities.
2. Advanced data augmentation techniques.
3. Enhanced integration with spiking neural network frameworks.
